    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe turns those normal apples into a tasty sweet dessert or even a snack! These cinnamon apples
        are perfect for that thanksgiving desert or for a nice fall day! With only a few ingredients and a little work,
        you can have this tasty treat ready to eat in just a short moment.

    <p>
        Just the cinnamon apples them self are super tasty and leaves you wanting more. But with a little imagination
        you can put some tasty topping on them to make them even more delicious! Some of my favorites are whipped cream,
        smashed strawberries, or even a little honey! There have been lots of more options people have thought about so don't
        be afraid to try some out that you think would be good!
